The motivation of this study is to determine the reliability of CAD outcomes in the presence of uncertainty in a multi-label classification problem.

The dataset used for the initial exploratory analysis was provided by Yung et al. from a previous study1. The data set is accessible at the following URL:  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zxq69reu1ez00xm/AACnbSXLHUg-Dqr6YYVwQl2Ba?dl=0. 

This dataset was based on the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, but has been preprocessed to contain only one slice per nodule with the the maximum intersection of pixels by the rating radiologists with an area greater than 25 pixels. While the final data set used in Yungâ€™s study focused on nodules with at least four raters and leveraged a consensus approach for the malignancy classification, we needed to process the data to capture agreement between raters, as well as the number of raters.
